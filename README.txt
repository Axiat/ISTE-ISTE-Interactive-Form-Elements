Welcome to my Dynamic JS Project!
- Essentially this is a short survival game, where the user is given a situation and is asked
  to make decisions that either lead to their death or survival.


What makes this project special

1.) I took a different approach to this project than most people. Instead of asking the user a
    question, the user is instead asked to make a "decision" in order to "survive" this
    game. Ultimately it's the same functionality, but this will be a nice change of pace from other
    projects.

2.) This little survival game is completely modular. Because I programmed the csv parser
    to be as generic as possible, you can add as many options under a question as you want.


3.) The CSV parsing format makes it easy to add and remove elements to the game. Adding
    little narratives and formatting them nicely is very easy to do. It's also very easy to add
    pictures and reuse pictures if you wanted to.

4.) Now i'm a bit biased, but I think I nailed the ambiance and the color scheme of this project.

5.) My code is well-documented which makes navigating it a breeze.
