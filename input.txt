//  Instructions:
//  1.) Blank lines are ignored
//
//  2.) Use "//" to comment (all lines with this symbol are ignored)
//
//  3.) All entries must have a parent. Setting a question as it's own parent
//      is a good way to fill this requirement without any negative effects.
//
//  3.) Each line is written in the format:   " question | parent"
//      - It's worth noting that you can alias a question
//        to prevent unneeded repetition by using the syntax
//        "alias : question". White space does not matter and
//        aliases can be any symbol (not just numbers).
//
//  4.) should you choose to alias a question, you must use the alias to refer
//      to the original question
