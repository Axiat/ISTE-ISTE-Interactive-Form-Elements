//  Instructions:
//  1.) Blank lines, whitespace and tabs are ignored
//
//  2.) Use "//" to comment (all lines with this symbol are ignored)
//
//  3.) All entries must have a parent. Setting a question as it's own parent
//      is a good way to fill this requirement without any negative effects.
//          Ex.) "my question" | "my question | picture1, picture2 |"
//            - if a picture is not in the top level directory of the assets/images/ folder,
//              then write the path to the picture instead.
//
//  4.) Each line is written in the format:   " question | parent | pictures | text[ (your message here) ]"
//      - Pictures and tex[]  part is completely optional, but if you use text[], you must leave
//        the picture part empty.
//      - It's worth noting that you can alias a question
//        to prevent unneeded repetition by using the syntax
//        "alias : question". White space does not matter and
//        aliases can be any symbol (not just numbers).
//      Ex.) 1: Question A | 1
//              -> Question A can now be referenced by the symbol "1" and has itself as
//                  as a parent (which is not displayed in this program)
//
//  5.) should you choose to alias a question, you must use the alias to refer
//      to the original question
//
//  6.) Assigning a message to a question is optional, but if you choose to do so, there
//      are a few rules.
//          1.) you must use the syntax "text[ (your message here ]" to denote a message
//          2.) you can have multi-line messages (helps with formatting long messages in this file)
//              2a.) If you choose to do a multi-line message, you must leave the "text[" string in
//                   in the same line as the question you want it to be assigned to.

                            You’re jolted awake by the intense ringing in your ears. Groggy and disoriented,
                            you gather yourself and look around – taking in your surroundings. You notice that
                            you're leaning up against a small boulder. You have no idea where you are or how you go
                            there. Off in the distance you hear a single low-pitched whistle.
