//  Instructions:
//  1.) Blank lines, whitespace and tabs are ignored
//
//  2.) Use "//" to comment (all lines with this symbol are ignored)
//
//  3.) All entries must have a parent. Setting a question as it's own parent
//      is a good way to fill this requirement without any negative effects.
//          Ex.) "my question" | "my question | picture1, picture2"
//            - if a picture is not in the top level directory of the assets/images/ folder,
//              then write the path to the picture instead.
//
//  4.) Each line is written in the format:   " question | parent | pictures"
//      - Pictures part is completely optional
//      - It's worth noting that you can alias a question
//        to prevent unneeded repetition by using the syntax
//        "alias : question". White space does not matter and
//        aliases can be any symbol (not just numbers).
//      Ex.) 1: Question A | 1
//              -> Question A can now be referenced by the symbol "1" and has itself as
//                  as a parent (which is not displayed in this program)
//
//  5.) should you choose to alias a question, you must use the alias to refer
//      to the original question
